# ImagePop

The program ImagePop.py is currently developed and 
supported by the authors of this paper, Lowell 
Everest Schudel and Sol Weatherford Courtney, 
both students in the Department of Astronomy 
and Astrophysics at Columbia University in New 
York City New York. It is our hope for this 
program to be openly developed and contributed 
to by the larger Astronomical society and serve 
as a simple but useful tool for anyone whom finds 
him or herself at work under a telescope.

All questions and comments should be sent to either 
swc2124@columbia.edu or les2185@columbia.edu to be addressed.
